```

## Problem 1
Use `dim(state.x77)` to determine the dimensions (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
Use `rownames(state.x77)` and `colnames(state.x77)` to see the row and column
names. Use `head(state.x77)` and `tail(state.x77)` to examine the first and last 6
rows.


```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

## Problem 2
Access the help file on `state.x77`. Briefly summarize each variable in the matrix,
including the units of measurement and years the data were collected, if that information is provided. Note that although the help does not say it, the state population is
measured in thousands of people and the income is measured in dollars.
```{r}
# Your code goes here
```
Your brief summmary of each variable in the matrix goes here.
